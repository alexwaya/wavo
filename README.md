#Description
    WAVO, (name derived from its developers Wanjiiru, Alexander, Von and Odero) an HTML5 mobile application will solve the problems mentioned above as explained below.
    Wavo will have a communication channel customized for Moringa School community only. Members will be able to create accounts using emails as in the Moringa School database as theyâ€™ve registered courses or using their staff emails. 
    Moringa School will have contacts with landlords around. In the event a vacant is available, landlords will notify the admin who will publish relevant information at the accommodation section.
    A shop section will be available on the app where only trusted vendors will be allowed to post their items for sale. The shop will come with a MoringaCoin, a crypto currency that buyers will earn points by buying with it on the app.
